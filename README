How many times does it happen that you keep downloading pdfs and then you can't find out which document contains what?

To help solve this problem, we have developed this small piece of software which will help you find out which document contains what.

To simplify things even further, you can run it in two modes
1. Run it on your server. Just donwload this source and get started.
2. Use our servers! You can be sure that these are completely private and nobody else will have access to your pdfs.
